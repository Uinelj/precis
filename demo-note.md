# Demo

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com).

# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
