# Hi

French computer science student @[UCP](https://www.u-cergy.fr)/[ENSEA](http://www.ensea.fr/), interested in bio-inspired artificial intelligence, machine learning, tiny broken projects and music.

You will find here my [blog](t), [projects](t?t=projects)/[games](t?t=games), [where](t?p=about) to find me, [what](t?p=now) I'm doing now or the [links](http://chad.ujj.space) I saved and will never read.

This website runs on [tibl](https://ujj.space/tibl), a tiny client side blog engine that runs ontop of Github Pages.

You can contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Uinelj).

Have a good one!
